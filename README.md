# Indoor-Robot-Localization-Using-Ultrasonic-Sensors
This paper analyzes Monte Carlo Localization (MCL) method which is used to estimate the pose of an indoor mobile robot. A mobile robot must know where it is to navigate in indoor environment. MCL technique is one of the most influential and popular techniques for estimation of robot position and orientation using particle filter. For the analysis we perform experiments in an indoor environment with differential drive robot and ultrasonic range sensor system. The analysis uses MATLAB for implementation of the MCL. The analysis investigates the effect of control parameters to MCL performance. The control parameters are uncertainty of the motion model of the mobile robot and the noise level of the measurement model of the range sensor.
